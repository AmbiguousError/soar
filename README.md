# Pastel Glider - Floating Dreams ☁️✨

Welcome to Pastel Glider, a tranquil flying experience designed to let you soar through an endless, procedurally generated pastel world. Catch thermals, navigate gentle winds, and enjoy the serene landscapes as you aim for new heights.

## Description

Pastel Glider is a chill game about the joy of flight. There are no enemies, no complex scoring systems beyond reaching your altitude goal – just you, your glider, and an ever-changing, soft-hued world to explore. It's perfect for unwinding and enjoying a moment of peace.

## How to Play

* **UP Arrow**: Increase glider speed (trading potential height for speed).
* **DOWN Arrow**: Decrease glider speed (allowing for zoom climbs, trading speed for height).
* **LEFT/RIGHT Arrows**: Bank the glider to turn.
* **ESCAPE**: 
    * During gameplay: Returns to the main menu.
    * After reaching a level goal and choosing to "Continue Flying": Opens a menu to go to the next level, quit, or resume.

## Features

* **Endless Pastel World**: Each level generates a brand new, unique map with diverse, soft-colored biomes including plains, forests, mountains, deserts, and rivers.
* **Dynamic Wind**: Experience gentle wind changes with each new level, affecting your flight path. A handy weather vane on your HUD shows the current wind direction and strength.
* **Thermals**: Ride columns of rising air (thermals) to gain altitude effortlessly. Their strength and size vary, and they are more prominent over certain land types.
* **Multiple Difficulty Modes**:
    * **N00b**: For a super relaxed experience with very large, long-lasting, and powerful thermals.
    * **Easy**: Thermals are noticeably stronger and more helpful.
    * **Normal**: A balanced, standard gliding challenge.
* **Altitude Meter with VSI**: Keep an eye on your height and your rate of climb/descent with the on-screen indicator.
* **Chilled Aesthetics**: Soft pastel colors for the world, glider, and UI elements create a calming visual experience.
* **Parallax Clouds**: Gentle clouds drift by, adding to the sense of depth and atmosphere.

## Goal

The primary goal in each level is to reach an altitude of **1000 meters**. Once achieved, you'll have the option to:
* **Move On**: Start the next level with a fresh map and new challenges.
* **Continue Flying**: Keep exploring the current level at your leisure. If you choose this, pressing `ESCAPE` will bring up a menu to proceed to the next level or quit.
